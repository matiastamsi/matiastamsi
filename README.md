## Some projects over the years

When I participated in Software Development project, which is a project of University of Helsinki and is part of bachelor's studies, I got myself into a fascinating project! I worked over 200 hours with the awesome co-workers and client while developing an API to benchmark quantum algoritms. Here is the [link to the organization](https://github.com/quantum-ohtu).

When I had the Data Structures Lab, I made a [cipher cracker](https://github.com/matiastamsi/tiralabra) that uses frequency analysis. We couldn't use ready data structures or algoritms in the main fuctionality (some exceptions were allowed regarding reading files etc.)

[Fisher's best friend](https://github.com/matiastamsi/KalastajanKaveri) was my second project and it was part of Database Lab which is part of my studies.

My first project is a [flyfishing game](https://github.com/matiastamsi/ot-harjoitustyo) (flyfishing is my huge passion). It was right after I learned to code as a project of one course, so you have been warned! At least I have made progress from that!
