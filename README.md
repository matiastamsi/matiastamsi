## Some projects over the years

When I participated in a_Software Development_ course (which was a part of my bachelor's studies), I got myself into a fascinating project! I worked over 230 hours while developing an API to benchmark quantum algoritms. Here is the [link to the organization](https://github.com/quantum-ohtu).

When I had a course called _Data Structures Lab_, I made a [cipher cracker](https://github.com/matiastamsi/tiralabra) that uses frequency analysis. We couldn't use any ready data structures or algoritms in the main fuctionality.

[Fisher's best friend](https://github.com/matiastamsi/KalastajanKaveri) was my second project and it was a part of a course called _Database Lab_.

My first project was a [flyfishing game](https://github.com/matiastamsi/ot-harjoitustyo) (flyfishing is my huge passion). It was right after when I learned to program, so you have been warned! At least I have made progress from that!
